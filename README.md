# Website for Visualizing TrackMan Baseball Data

## Overview
This project's purpose is to design and manage a website using Flask, Bootstrap, and AWS to provide an on-line data service which aims at improving baseball organizations’ data usage efficiency by enabling the organizations to visualize their TrackMan baseball data with multiple filters, such as pitch type and handedness of pitcher.  

This application first calculates several baseball metrics such as swing-and-miss percentage based on the selected filters and further displays 2D heatmaps to depict those metrics across the pitched ball’s horizontal and vertical locations, movements, or angles, which can also be selected as a filter by the users.

## Steps
1. Upload your TrackMan baseball data
2. Select the filters
3. Submit and get the 2D heatmaps
